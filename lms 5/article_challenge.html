  <h1>Sorry,
  Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids <br>
  From Tech Addiction</h1>


  We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. <br>
  The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful. <br> <br>



  Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids From Tech Addiction <br> <br>

  <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/user/kathleen-davis" target="_blank">BY KATHLEEN DAVIS</a> LONG READ <br> <br>


  “I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as <br>
  is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. Not <br>
  wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, <br>
  holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the <br>
  cutest/most pathetic thing.” <br> <br>



  That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small <br>
  child’s burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a <br>
  waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average <br>
  American adult spends about <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html">11 hours a day looking at a screen)</a> . She, <br>
  like many modern parents, sees her own tech dependency reflected in <br>
  her children’s habits. She doesn’t always like what she sees. <br> <br>



  Even as we learn about the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40520843/silicon-valley-technology-regulate-gadgets-and-apps-like-cigarettes">potential pitfalls</a>  of our increasingly <br>
  technology-addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little sign <br>
  of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, <br>
  especially when it comes to kids. <br> <br>



  In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an <br>
  early employee at Facebook,<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40506058/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society">said that the social network was “ripping <br>
  apart the social fabric of how society works.”</a>   Tristan Harris, a former <br>
  product manager at Google, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/">told Wired</a>  that Apple, Google, Facebook, <br>
  Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time <br>
  and attention. In January, two Apple investors asked the company to <br>
  study the health effects of its products on children. <br> <br>



  Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from <br>
  some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple, Google, and <br>
  Facebook–formed the <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> . In partnership <br>
  with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the <br>
  group plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40526553/truth-about-tech-campaign-aims-to-pressure-tech-giants-to-make-less-addictive-products">$7 <br>
  million “Truth about Tech” ad campaig</a> n that they plan to deliver to <br>
  55,000 public schools. <br> <br>

  Solvable Design Problem</a>
<hr> <br> <br>



  That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are <br>
  now banding together to warn parents about the monster <br>
  they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to <br>
  question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that <br>
  an ad campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail <br>
  our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being <br>
  introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital/dp/1610396723">The Art of Screen <br> Time </a>  <br>
   Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5- <br>
  year-olds) that found that young kids spend about four hours a day in <br>
  the company of (all types of) screens. <br> <br>



  To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast <br>
  Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from <br>
  all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types <br>
  of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of <br>
  technology, to the benefits that technology can provide to families. We <br>
  also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech <br>
  addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the <br>
  most telling answers of all. <br> <br>



  The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a <br>
  few other countries). Their professions span many industries, including <br>
  marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video <br>
  production, law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or <br>
  two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of <br>
  participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these <br>
  parents are in the thick of parenting. <br> <br>



  Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a <br>
  conclusive sample–but, along with expert research, these parents’ <br>
  insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in <br>
  our tech-dependent era. <br> <br>
