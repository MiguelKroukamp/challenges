    <h1>My favourite dish</h1>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Method
  The day before, or at least a few hours before cooking, put all the ingredients in a large <br> sandwich bag (pick and finely chop the <em><strong>rosemary</strong> </em>  first). <br> <br>
  Squeeze out the air then spend a few minutes massaging all the flavours into the <em><strong>meat</strong> </em>. Put <br> in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. <br> <br>
  About 1½ hours before you’re ready to cook, remove the <em><strong>beef</strong> </em> from the fridge and place in a <br> cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to room temperature. <br> <br>
  Preheat your barbecue. Put a few knobs of chilled <em><strong>butter</strong> </em> into a bowl of <em> <strong>cold water</strong> </em> and take <br> those outside with you when you’re ready to cook. <br> <br>
  This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time <br> is taking the <em> <strong>fillet</strong> </em> out of the bag, quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in <em><strong>olive oil</strong> </em> <br> and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a chilled <br> knob of <em><strong>butter</strong> </em> butter as you cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute. <br> <br>

  Once it looks good, move the fillet to a cooler part of the barbecue to finish cooking to your <br> liking. Another 4 to 5 minutes, turning every minute, should give you medium-done meat. If <br> you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It’s better to err on the side <br> of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take the fillet off, slice into it <br> and find that it’s under-cooked, then have to put it back. <br> <br>
  When you’re happy, put it on a platter, rub it again with <em> <strong>butter</strong> </em> so it really shines, then <br> drizzle over more <em> <strong> Worcestershire sauce</strong> </em>, <em> <strong> extra virgin olive oil and thyme and rosemary flowers </strong> </em>,  <br> , if you have them. <br> <br>
  Let the meat rest for a few minutes, before slicing at the table. Season from a height then <br> quickly rub the slices in the juices before you let everyone grab some. <br><br> </p>
